Tic Tac Toe -- human vs. computer

What modules should we implement?

UI module
    -- user interface layer - all print/input goes here
    -- display the game board on console
    -- show any errors
    -- say who won/draw?
    -- call Game module for making moves on the board

Game module
    -- decide where the computer makes its next move

Board module
    -- represent the board's state
    -- check if the game was won / drawn
    -- check for any errors? (trying to place outside the board)

Function call directions

UI -> Game
   -> Board
Game -> Board
