1. Calculate the maximum subarray sum (subarray = elements having 
continuous indices)

    e.g.
    for data = [-2, -5, 6, -2, -3, 1, 5, -6], maximum subarray sum is 7.

2. Knapsack problem. Given the weights and values of N items, put them in a knapsack having capacity W so that you

4. Count in how many ways we can provide change to a given sum of money (N), when provided infinite
   supply of given coin denominations.

   e.g. Let's say N = 10, and we have coins of values (1, 5, 10); we can give change in 4 ways (10, 5 + 5, 5 + 1 + ... 
   and 1 + ... + 1)
