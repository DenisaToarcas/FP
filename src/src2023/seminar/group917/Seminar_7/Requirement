Implement a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with a console interface.

1) Board is 3x3, to user 1-indexed
2) User always starts, with symbol X; Computer plays with O
3) User should be able to place a given X on the board by saying:
        play [row] [column] , which places an X on the given row and column

        e.g. play 1 2 places an X on the first row, second column
4) Computer plays random, valid moves
5) Check for wins/draws, stop game
5) Illegal game play is signaled using error messages
    --placement outside the board
    --placement in a position where there is something already

Print the board after every move (either computer's or human's)

Use functions that do only one thing - only computations, or only printing.
Pass information through parameters.
Use exception mechanisms to handle illegal game play.
Separate program into modules.
